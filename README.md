# FLAB-Putter
Open source putter that is (in theory) lie angle balanced. Heavily based on a LAB Mezz.

A center shafted mallet style putter that should be very configurable. The idea is that the face insert and the shaft block should be able to be easily removed and swapped. I wanted the ability to change a milled face for a smooth face, or a change out the shaft on the course.

The putter is also very heavy in it's current state. This wasn't intentional at first, but with some real world testing it's actually been quite beneficial. The current theory is that because it has such a high MOI, paired with it being lie angle balanced, the putter is very difficult to twist in the stroke. Most people that have used it struggle with pace control for the first few rolls, but consistently hit their line. After adjusting to the weight, it's rolled well for almost everyone. However, it could probably still afford to lose some weight while maintaining a high MOI; finding the sweet spot will take some testing
